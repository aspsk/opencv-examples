# difffie

A simple highgui-based program which helps to visualize the difference between
two images: it displays first image, their difference, and the second image in
the same window:

     +-----------+-----------+-----------+
     |           |           |           |
     |     1     | Diff(1,2) |     2     |
     |           |           |           |
     +-----------+-----------+-----------+

## Usage

    $ difffie one.jpg another.jpg

Then use the following controls:

  * Press `'+'` to magnify the image
  * Press `'-'` to demagnify the image
  * Press `Esc` to exit the program
